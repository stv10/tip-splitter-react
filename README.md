## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap](https://tip-splitter-react.vercel.app/) - For styles


### Continued development

I think i need to practice my bootstrap skills more, designing the interface is taking a lot of time to me, learn how to use flex and grid box in a better and faster way to be more 

I didn't get to put the invalid state on the Number of people input when it is zero, so it's a thing to do in these days
